# About my little Bitcoin price tracker

This web script reads current and historical prices from [Bitcoinaverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/markets#USD) and presents the prices from some selected points in time.

There's a "semi-logarithmic" timescale of 3 day, 1 week, 1 month (30 days), 6 months, and 1 year. In addition, price from 1 Jan of the current year, this year's high, and this year's low are included. 

I've also included the current (Sep 2014) record high price from Nov 2013.

In the data files from Bitcoinaverage, historical days have average, high, and low volume-weighted prices. The prices in the tables are average for each day, except of the highs and lows mentioned above.
