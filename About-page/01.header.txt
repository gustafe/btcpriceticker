# About my little Bitcoin price tracker

This web script reads current and historical prices from
[Bitcoinaverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/en/bitcoin-price/btc-to-usd)
and presents the prices from some selected points in time.

There's a "semi-logarithmic" timescale of 3 days, 1 week, 1 month (30 days), 6 months, and 1 year. In addition, price from 1 Jan of the current year, this year's high, and this year's low are included. 

I've also included the current record high price (commonly referred to
as "All time high").

In the data files from Bitcoinaverage, historical days have average,
high, and low volume-weighted prices. The prices in the tables are
average for each day, except of the highs and lows mentioned above.

## <a id="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer

Price data accuracy and timeliness is neither implied nor guaranteed.

This service uses a free, rate-limited service from
[Bitcoinaverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/). It can be interrupted
or terminated at any time.

The data as presented is based on my understanding of the data feed,
and may not confirm with currently accepted models of BTC price data.

*Update 2019-05-17* From 2019-03-03, the data in the historical section is not from Bitcoinaverage directly. Instead it is derived from the ticker data that is sampled at regular intervals during the day.

This is because my free API key has expired.

Regression testing has shown that the value for the average price is close to the canonical data, but the values for highs, lows, and averages are not the same.
