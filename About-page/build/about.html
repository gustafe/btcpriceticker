<h1>About my little Bitcoin price tracker</h1>

<p>This web script reads current and historical prices from
<a href="https://bitcoinaverage.com/en/bitcoin-price/btc-to-usd">Bitcoinaverage</a>
and presents the prices from some selected points in time.</p>

<p>There's a "semi-logarithmic" timescale of 3 days, 1 week, 1 month (30 days), 6 months, and 1 year. In addition, price from 1 Jan of the current year, this year's high, and this year's low are included. </p>

<p>I've also included the current record high price (commonly referred to
as "All time high").</p>

<p>In the data files from Bitcoinaverage, historical days have average,
high, and low volume-weighted prices. The prices in the tables are
average for each day, except of the highs and lows mentioned above.</p>

<h2><a id="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Price data accuracy and timeliness is neither implied nor guaranteed.</p>

<p>This service uses a free, rate-limited service from
<a href="https://bitcoinaverage.com/">Bitcoinaverage</a>. It can be interrupted
or terminated at any time.</p>

<p>The data as presented is based on my understanding of the data feed,
and may not confirm with currently accepted models of BTC price data.</p>

<h2><a id="current"></a>Current price compared to historical prices</h2>

<h3>Percentage calculations</h3>

<p>The percentage in the table is </p>

<pre><code>percentage = ( current_price - historical_price ) / historical_price * 100
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the current price is calculated using the formula</p>

<pre><code>current_price = historical_price * (1 + percentage/100)
</code></pre>

<h3><a id="marketcap"></a>Market cap</h3>

<p>The number of coins at a certain date is calculated using extrapolated values from a sampling of blocks at a certain timestamp. This is pulled from the <a href="http://blockexplorer.com">Blockexplorer.com</a> API once a day. </p>

<p>Note that this is a naive definition of "market cap" and not really applicable to Bitcoin, as it's not a share in a company. However it's widely used as a sort of benchmark within the community.</p>

<h2><a id='extrapolated'></a>Historical prices compared to extrapolated trends</h2>

<p>It's often postulated that Bitcoin's underlying price development is
exponential (or rather, that it's in the "exponential" phase of a
S-shaped saturation curve). To compare this, I calculated a best-fit
line approximation against the natural log of the the average
historical price, and this calculated price is presented compared to
the actual prices.</p>

<p>I've also compared to a linear approximation, using the same
methodology but of course using the straight numbers.</p>

<p>I've excluded all data newer than 3 days. The coefficients are updated
daily. The values are shown in the headers.</p>

<p>I've used Julian dates to deal with the days, mostly because SQLite has built-in support for the datatype.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Q: why Perl? Why CGI? Are you some kind of Luddite?</p>

<p>A: Yes, it's what I'm most familiar with, and what's available on the server I'm using. I'm more interested in dealing with the actual data analysis, and I'm using tools I know about to deal with it.</p>

<p>Q: I love this page! Do you take Bitcoin donations?</p>

<p>A: Fame and appreciation is payment enough for me.</p>
