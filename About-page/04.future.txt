## <a id="future"></a> Future extrapolations

### Red Anniversary 

A received truth is that "no-one has ever lost money holding Bitcoin for one calendar year". We're a few months from testing that hypothesis. On the days leading up to 29 Nov 2014, the price rocketed from $130 to $1,100. 

As there's often no direct average price that's the same as the
current price, I've extrapolated the current price based on the slope
of the price increase. I've then added 365 days to that extrapolated
time and called that "red anniversary". If there's no new record high
before 29 Nov 2014, a buyer of Bitcoin will be "in the red" after a
year.
