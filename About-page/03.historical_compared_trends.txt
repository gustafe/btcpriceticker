## <a id='extrapolated'></a>Historical prices compared to extrapolated trends

It's often postulated that Bitcoin's underlying price development is
exponential (or rather, that it's in the "exponential" phase of a
S-shaped saturation curve). To compare this, I calculated a best-fit
line approximation against the natural log of the the average
historical price, and this calculated price is presented compared to
the actual prices.

I've also compared to a linear approximation, using the same
methodology but of course using the straight numbers.

I've excluded all data newer than 3 days. The coefficients are updated
daily. The values are shown in the headers.

I've used Julian dates to deal with the days, mostly because SQLite has built-in support for the datatype.
