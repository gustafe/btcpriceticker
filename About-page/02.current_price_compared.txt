## <a id="current"></a>Current price compared to historical prices

### Percentage calculations

The percentage in the table is 

    percentage = ( current_price - historical_price ) / historical_price * 100

This means that the current price is calculated using the formula

    current_price = historical_price * (1 + percentage/100)

### Market cap

The number of coins at a certain date is calculated using extrapolated values from a sampling of blocks at a certain timestamp. This is pulled from the [Blockexplorer.com](http://blockexplorer.com) API once a day. 

Note that this is a naive definition of "market cap" and not really applicable to Bitcoin, as it's not a share in a company. However it's widely used as a sort of benchmark within the community.
